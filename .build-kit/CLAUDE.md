# Project Configuration

Read Events in src/events to understand the global structure.

## File Structure Constraints

- **Strict Path Limitation**: if not instructed otherwise, only check `src/slices/{slicename}/*.ts`
- **Slice Organization**: Each feature/domain should be organized as a separate slice

## Code Standards

- **Language**: TypeScript only
- **Module System**: Use ES modules (import/export)
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all code is properly typed

## Development Guidelines

1. Each slice should be self-contained and focused on a specific domain
2. Maintain clear separation of concerns within each slice
3. Follow TypeScript best practices for type definitions and interfaces

Only check src/slices/{slice}/*.ts, do not check subfolders unless explicitely tasked to.
If not tasked explicitely to change routes, ignore routes*.ts

Ignore case for files and slices in prompts. "CartItems" slice is the same as "cartitems"

Do not change files with tests unless explicitely instructed: *.test.ts

At the start of every session, read `.build-kit/AGENTS.md` if it exists to load accumulated project learnings.

When starting to work on a slice, invoke the `update-slice-status` skill with `InProgress` status before doing anything else.

## Building a Slice

**CRITICAL: You MUST always use the provided skills to build slices. NEVER implement a slice manually.**
**ALL fields, event names, command names, and business rules MUST come exclusively from slice.json. Do NOT invent, assume, or guess any field or logic not present in the slice definition.**

**If, at any point below, the slice's requirements are genuinely ambiguous, contradictory, or missing
a decision you need in order to proceed — do not guess, and do not build anyway.** Invoke the
`request-feedback` skill with the specific question; it posts the question as a comment on the slice
and marks it `Blocked`, and you then stop work on this slice for this run. This is an escalation path,
not a routine step — read `slice.json` and the matching build skill's own instructions fully first;
most slices are fully specified and need none of this.

When asked to build a slice, always follow this flow:

1. Read the slice definition from `.build-kit/.slices/<context>/<slicename>/slice.json`.
2. Determine the slice type:
   - **Webhook** — `sliceType === "WEBHOOK"` → invoke `/build-webhook`
   - **Translation** — `sliceType === "TRANSLATION"` → read `description` and `notes` from slice.json; use `/build-webhook` if notes describe an HTTP endpoint, otherwise default to `/build-automation`
   - **Automation** — `processors` array is non-empty → invoke `/build-automation`
   - **State-view** — `projections` or `queries` array is non-empty → invoke `/build-state-view`
   - **State-change** — default (has `commands` / `events`) → invoke `/build-state-change`
3. Invoke the matching skill and follow its instructions completely. Do not deviate.
4. **Verify against slice.json**: After the skill completes, check that every command field, event field, and specification in slice.json appears in the implementation. No invented fields — if it is not in slice.json, it must not be in the code.
5. Run quality checks (`npm run build`, then the slice tests only).
6. If checks pass, commit with `feat: [Slice Name]` and set slice status to `Done`.

After you are done, automatically run the tests for the slice that was edited.
